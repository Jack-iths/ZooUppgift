# Skapa ett Zoo – Checklist

1. [x] Create a Simple Class:  
   Create a class named Animal with two properties: Name (string) and Species (string).

2. [x] Add a Constructor:  
   Add a constructor to the Animal class that sets the Name and Species properties.

3. [x] Create a Method:  
   Add a method to the Animal class named MakeSound that returns a string, like "Some sound!".

4. [x] Instantiate the Class:  
   Create a new instance of the Animal class and set its Name and Species properties. Print these properties to the console.

5. [x] Add More Properties:  
   Extend the Animal class by adding another property named Diet (string) that indicates whether the animal is Herbivore, Carnivore, or Omnivore.

6. [x] Encapsulation:  
   Make the Species property private and provide a public method named GetSpecies to retrieve its value.

7. [x] Add Different Animals:  
   Create instances of different animals like elephant, giraffe, tiger, etc. and print their names, species, and diets.

8. [x] Use a List:  
   Create a List<Animal> to represent a section of the zoo. Add several Animal objects to it. Then, loop through the list and print out the details of each animal.

9. [x] Add a Zookeeper:  
   Create a Zookeeper class with properties Name and a method FeedAnimal. The method should accept an Animal object and print something like "{Zookeeper's name} is feeding {Animal's name}."

10. [x] Interaction:  
    Instantiate a zookeeper and have them feed a few animals from your list. This will give you a feel for how objects interact with each other.
